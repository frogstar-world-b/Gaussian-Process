# Gaussian-Process

Currently there are 3 notebooks in this repo.

## Introduction to the Gaussian Process 

This notebook provides an introduction to GPs and code to generate samples from GPs with different mean and covariance parameters. The notebook uses [`rise`](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to generate slides. Click on the binder link below to view slides.
